# Q-A-Chatbot-with-Ollama

This project is a Q&A Chatbot built using Ollama and hosted on a sleek and interactive Streamlit application. The chatbot leverages open-source large language models (LLMs) like Gemma 2, Llama 3.2, and Mistral to generate intelligent and conversational responses to user queries. The app allows users to seamlessly interact with different models, fine-tune response parameters, and explore the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs.
